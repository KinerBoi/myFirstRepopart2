I think a did learn alot about how CS can apply to me in the future, and especially related to Colin, who's majoring in Mechanical Engineering (a major that I am interested in along with CS and Electrical Engineering) and how he ended up relating the two different STEM topics together in order to set him up for success. I also learned a great deal about intersnhips and clubs in UC schools, and hope to get into an internship in either college or for major industrial manufacturing firms and contractors, one good one in the meeting being mentioned (Northrupp Grumman). Hopefully, when I recieve my greencard, I can go beyond and chase those desires! The meeting was really fun and interesting (especially the jokes the alumni came up with) and for my first meeting this is what I took away from the meeting, that no matter what STEM field you will be in there will still be a use for CS. I hope to participate in more of these meetings in the future!\n", "\n" ] } ], "metadata": { "kernelspec": { "display_name": "Python 3.8.10 64-bit", "language": "python", "name": "python3" }, "language_info": { "name": "python", "version": "3.8.10" }, "orig_nbformat": 4, "vscode": { "interpreter": { "hash": "916dbcbb3f70747c44a77c7bcd40155683ae19c65e1c03b4aa3499c5328201f1" } } }, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2 }]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello World in Python</title><link href="https://kinerboi.github.io/myFirstRepopart2/cb/2022/08/29/.08.21-Hello-World.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello World in Python" /><published>2022-08-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://kinerboi.github.io/myFirstRepopart2/cb/2022/08/29/.08.21-Hello-World</id><author><name></name></author><category term="CB" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello World in Java</title><link href="https://kinerboi.github.io/myFirstRepopart2/cb/2022/08/29/.08.21-Hello-Java-World.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello World in Java" /><published>2022-08-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://kinerboi.github.io/myFirstRepopart2/cb/2022/08/29/.08.21-Hello-Java-World</id><author><name></name></author><category term="CB" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Deji finally wins a boxing match!</title><link href="https://kinerboi.github.io/myFirstRepopart2/markdown/2022/08/27/Deji-vs-Fousey.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Deji finally wins a boxing match!" /><published>2022-08-27T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://kinerboi.github.io/myFirstRepopart2/markdown/2022/08/27/Deji-vs-Fousey</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bro is now 1-3]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bash Checks</title><link href="https://kinerboi.github.io/myFirstRepopart2/pbl/2022/08/26/BashCheck.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bash Checks" /><published>2022-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://kinerboi.github.io/myFirstRepopart2/pbl/2022/08/26/BashCheck</id><author><name></name></author><category term="PBL" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[checking whether everything has been installed]]></summary></entry></feed>
