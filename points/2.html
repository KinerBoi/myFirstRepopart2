<blockquote>
  <p>Background.  Build a new Console or Desktop GUI lab showing an area of interest between you and your pair or even as 4s.  Focus is using a the Java Math Class, Planning, and Creating.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In planning, the Teacher views Java as a backend language.  So, the Console or Desktop UI could be used to serve as an administrative UI for backend developers.</li>
    <li>Ultimately, for Trimester 1  N@tM final we will be building a Web frontend using the foundation provide by Fastpages.  IMO, the best option for an Administrative UI would be Java using Spring/Spring Boot;  but we may need something more rapid and centralized on Java.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Action.  Build a rapid Java based Administrative UI thinking about Math class and Math operations as a focus.  A positive, would be starting to build something that you might be interested in for the Trimester N@tM final.<br>
    - Make a Console application to visualize data from something like Math, Physics, using Jupyter Notebook and Scanner.
    - Make a Java Swing App and explore making a menu with a couple of unique interfaces showing different types of Math Calculators.
    - Idea of your choice</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each individual needs to perform their own work. However, I would like to see a plan that show you worked with Pair and/or Team.  The presentation can be according to your own style, but consider the following…</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Note.  A Live Review is expecting students to drive dialog and questions.  Additionally, learn that Teacher likes: questions, discussion of failures, showing a progressive mindset.</li>
    <li>Individual.  Blogging or Issues that highlights key learnings and takeaways from Code.org</li>
    <li>Pair/Team.  Blogging or Issues that shows Math Library Project / Or Idea of Choice
      <ul>
        <li>A shared repository, team or pair.  My suggestion is using Spring Portfolio project as template, as this is the start to a backend project.   In my projects, I have placed “hacks” directory inside of Spring project and it has worked fine.  Later you may want to expand on ideas and make them serviceable via APIs.</li>
        <li>Issues or Blog that show you have planned to divide up work between pair and team</li>
        <li>Jupyter notebook or Posts that highlights key code requirements, consideration should be made to find or run it quickly.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Review and Review Ticket.
      <ul>
        <li>Every time requirements.
          <ul>
            <li>Create Comment in this Points Blog.  Include crossover grades, crossover comments, and blog(s) used during week.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to present fast, be clear, and show everything in under 5 minutes.  3.5 minutes is preferred time for 4 people.</li>
            <li>Jupyter Notebooks contain comments and markdown cells that describe work.</li>
            <li>Output of Jupyter Notebook is required when posting the Blog.</li>
          </ul>
