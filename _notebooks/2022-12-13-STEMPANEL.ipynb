    "From the computer science and technical business panel, I learned a lot. The first thing that I learned was that it was never too late to pursue what you are interested in, and to always try new things. I saw that from both panelists, who switched multiple jobs pursuing what they loved, even as time passed on for them. Another thing which I took away from this lesson would be how impactful our generation comping up will be in the technology field, exemplified by Mrs.Beveridge who exemplified how the companies she worked for, such as HP and Qualcomm were committed to making our world a better place with advancements in STEM, solving many of the problems our society faces in the modern age. One final but important nonetheless connection that I made would be to Mr.Porter, who worked as a computer engineer. As being a computer/electrical engineer is my dream job, it was refreshing to hear someone talk about ther profession a little which I could relate to, and also comforted me on how even though one gets a degree for a course, in the real world one would be able to apply their knowledge to numerous fields, something that I resonate with as someone who would like to a a little bit of everything. Overall, this meeting was very enlightening, and I was glad to hear this panel!"
