    "Imagine you wanted to create a racing game. You would need a bunch of different cars-bugattis, lamborghinis, rolls royce. Each of these cars would have different features; they would have different fuel types, tires, and engines. A car like an Aston Martin would have a spoiler inside the car for aerodynamics. Lambos have cools doors for when you pull up to a race. But all of these cars would also have a lot in common; all cars have gear shifts, gas, breaks, and steering. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could model each car with its own class, with attributes and methods specific to each car. But we would find that we're repeating a lot of the same code over and over - it doesn't really make sense to redefine the methods for gas and breaks for every single car, when it will do the same thing.\n",
