Each of these cars would have different features; they would have different fuel types, tires, and engines. A car like an Aston Martin would have a spoiler inside the car for aerodynamics. Lambos have cools doors for when you pull up to a race. But all of these cars would also have a lot in common; all cars have gear shifts, gas, breaks, and steering. \n",
