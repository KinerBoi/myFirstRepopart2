    "The point of switch cases statements are to do certain commands if certain parameters are met. For example in this code, A person inputs the date of their birth, and if the date of birth falls within a certain range, the swtich command respective to that range is activated and returns the output, in this case a print function telling the star sign and the values of it. It is similar to if and else statements, but instead of having an else statement just executes the commands which are defined under the switch ranges. As switch cases do not support ranges, an if statement with a new variable called value is needed in order to give the ranges a particlar value, something which can be called into the switch case."
