<p>As I’ve started to realize over the last few months, starting as a Junior but becoming even more clear as a Senior,
is that people in highschool especially Del Norte are stressed over many things; grades, relationships, their mental
health, and extracirriculars. Something that has popped up especially for us seniors would be college applications, the anxiety of which colleges would accept us for all of our feats in highschool, good or bad. I made this blog in order to describe what I am grateful for, and what I hope for my future as life goes on.</p>

<h1 id="what-im-grateful-for">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-im-grateful-for" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Im grateful for:</h1>
<p>-I’m grateful for living under a roof, something that many people around the world do not afford.
    -Even if it is a small house compared to the rest of the houses in the 4s/Del Sur area, I’m still glad to atleast be in a house
-I’m grateful for living with two parents, who even though have a lot of fights stil resolve them so that I wont be affected
-Im grateful for food and water, cant live without it and tastes good too
-Im grateful for having close friends, I feel that this is important especially in a place like DN where many friendships are made just for academic purposes, and where a lot of people backstab each other
-Im grateful for the gym and all the sports that I’ve played as a child, made me physically stronger and more athletic
-Im grateful for my electronic devices, help me learn and also provide entertainment
-Im grateful for all the setbacks that I have had in my life, they have given me undaunted resolve and help mentally and emotionally strengthen myself
-Even though at times it can get stressful, I am also grateful for living in a great community and going to good schools such as Oak Valley Middle School and Del Norte High School, I got a great education and made good friends with whom I’ve shared the best moments of my life over the past 7 years. I cant imagine going to college without everyone from this community, its become so close-knit and I cant imagine meeting new people</p>

<p>As I leave high school and go on to adulthood and subsequently college, I will remember 4s and all the people here. However, as an ambitious person, I aim to shoot for the stars and make my own legacy, something that people all over the world will remember. Just what exaclty it is yet I do not know, but I do feel like I am destined for greatness. Some short term goals that I have for my life would be learning how to code in Java, learning more material in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and getting better at essay writing academically. Physically, I would like to get stronger in general, do more than 5 pullups, be able to benchpress 2 plates in one year, and become really good at lacrosse and contribute to the Varsity team. This post will serve as a reminder for all the goals that I have for myself, and will help me continue to drive forward and be the best version of myself that I possibly can be.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#things-i-took-from-video" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Things I took from video</h1>
<p>-Perspective matters
-Help others as much as I can
-Dont try to close yourself off to other people, talk your emotions out</p>
